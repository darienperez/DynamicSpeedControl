# DynamicSpeedControl
My first package! Goal is to identify terrain and use that information to control UAV velocities

Use local raster_path and pass to initialize to get started!

In my case it's

raster_path = "/Users/darien/Desktop/Academia/Research/UAV Applications/Dr. Jacob's Research/Code/Julia/DynamicSpeedControl/data/rasters/processed/ortho_2_20_2021_uncorrected_6348_NAD83_19N.tif"

kf_path = "/Users/darien/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-USNH/UNH BAA Cold Regions - Orthos/P4/KF_ortho_P4_2024_01_23.tif"
